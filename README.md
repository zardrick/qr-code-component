## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice responsive design techniques, specifically ensuring a **portrait layout** on smaller screens. I also improved my understanding of **media queries** and how to adapt component sizes dynamically. Below is an example of a media query I used:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .component-container {
        width: 80%;
        max-width: 320px;
        height: 75vh;
        max-height: 500px;
        gap: 20px;
    }
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my responsiveness skills by working on more **mobile-first designs** and experimenting with **CSS Grid** in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) - Helped me refine my media query logic.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me structure the layout efficiently.
